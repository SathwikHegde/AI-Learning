This video lecture covers the history of AI, which dates back to the 1950s when a group of researchers discussed the potential of AI at Dartmouth College. Since then, numerous algorithms have been developed, including perceptron, multilayer perceptron, support vector machines, and deep learning. Deep learning has become particularly popular in recent years due to increased computational power and data storage capabilities. It is important to be aware of the hype surrounding AI and to approach its potential applications with caution.
