This video lecture discusses that when considering the potential of AI, it is important to differentiate between what is possible and what is not yet feasible. Self-driving cars are getting closer to reality, while chatbots that can replace human customer service agents are not yet possible. The same algorithms can have different accuracies across different problems and industries, so it is important to carefully choose the appropriate algorithm for each application.
